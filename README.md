MAX/MSP Plug-ins
================

cheb.c
------
An implementation of a Chebyshev recursive filter for MAX/MSP.

This was my first attempt at writing a plug-in for the MAX programming environment. It was build with Metrowerks Codewarrior. It's an implementation of the algorithm presented by Stephen W. Smith in his book "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing" 2nd edition.

It has a particular "sound" that's interesting and useful. It needs additional code to prevent the "zipper" effect or to smooth the transitions between settings.
